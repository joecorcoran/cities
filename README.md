# Cities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joecorcoran/cities.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joecorcoran/cities) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/joecorcoran/cities.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/joecorcoran/cities)

All the cities of the world (according to the periodically updated MaxMind database).

## Data

To use this gem, you'll need the JSON data.

Download it, extract it and connect it up as follows.

```
$ wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cities-gem/cities.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf cities.tar.gz
```

```ruby
Cities.data_path = '/path/to/cities'
```

## Usage

Countries are identified by their [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes.

```ruby
cities = Cities.cities_in_country('GB')
  #=> { "abberley"=> #<City:0x000001049b9ba0>, "abberton"=> #<City:0x000001049b9b50>, ... }

mcr = cities['manchester']
  #=> #<City:0x00000102fb4ea8>

mcr.name
  #=> "Manchester"

mcr.population
  #=> 395516

mcr.latlong
  #=> [53,5, -2.216667]
```

The database is exhaustive and certainly stretches the definition of the word "city".

```ruby
Cities.cities_in_country('GB')['buchlyvie'].population
  #=> 448
```

## Countries gem intregration

This gem was designed as an extension to the [Countries gem](https://github.com/hexorx/countries). Installing Cities adds two new instance methods to the `Country` class and one instance method to the `State`.

### Country
```ruby
us = Country.search('US')
  #=> #<Country:0x000001020cf5f0>

us.cities?
  #=> true

us.cities
  #=> { "abanda" => #<Cities::City:0x00000114b34a38>, ...  }
```

### State
```ruby
us = Country.search('US')
  #=> #<Country:0x000001020cf5f0>

alaska = us.states
  #=> {"AK"=>  #<struct ISO3166::Subdivision>, ... }

alaska.cities
  #=> { "adak" => #<Cities::City:0x00000114b34a38>, ...  }
```

## Caching

Sometimes you may want to not constantly want to read and parse the same large JSON data files.  So by default we cache in memory the parsed JSON.  To turn this off simply set the cache_data flag to false

```ruby
Country.cache_data = false
```

## Configuration options available are data_path and cache_data

```ruby
Country.configure do |config|
  config.data_path = '../data/cities'
  config.cache_data = false
end
```

## Specs

The default path for data is the following path

```
GEM_ROOT/data/cities
```

Or you can set the environment variable DATA_PATH

To run the specs bundle and run specs
```
=> bundle
=> rake
```
