# Cities

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joecorcoran/cities.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joecorcoran/cities) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/joecorcoran/cities.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/joecorcoran/cities)

All the cities of the world (according to the periodically updated MaxMind database).

## Data

To use this gem, you'll need the JSON data.

Download it, extract it and connect it up as follows.

```
$ wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cities-gem/cities.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf cities.tar.gz
```

```ruby
Cities.data_path = '/path/to/cities'
```

## Usage

Countries are identified by their [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes.

```ruby
cities = Cities.cities_in_country('GB')
  #=> { "abberley"=> #<City:0x000001049b9ba0>, "abberton"=> #<City:0x000001049b9b50>, ... }

mcr = cities['manchester']
  #=> #<City:0x00000102fb4ea8>

mcr.name
  #=> "Manchester"

mcr.population
  #=> 395516

mcr.latlong
  #=> [53,5, -2.216667]
```

The database is exhaustive and certainly stretches the definition of the word "city".

```ruby
Cities.cities_in_country('GB')['buchlyvie'].population
  #=> 448
```

## Countries

This gem was designed as an extension to the [Countries gem](https://github.com/hexorx/countries). Installing Cities adds two new instance methods to the `Country` class.

```ruby
us = Country.search('US')
  #=> #<Country:0x000001020cf5f0>

us.cities?
  #=> true

us.cities
  #=> { "abanda" => #<City:0x00000114b34a38>, ...  }
```
